# Pascal's Triangle

This project calculates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the project.

## Example Output

For 7 rows, the output will be:

```
1 
1 1 
1 2 1 
1 3 3 1 
1 4 6 4 1 
1 5 10 10 5 1 
1 6 15 20 15 6 1 
```

## SOLID Principles

The code follows the SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class has a single responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: The classes can be replaced with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: The classes do not depend on methods they do not use.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: The high-level modules do not depend on low-level modules. Both depend on abstractions.
